# Feylon

Feylon is a
[Concatenative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language)
[Stack-Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming)
[Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)
inspired by [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language))
and [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth).

Feylon is currently interpreted in Java, but may be compiled to a native binary in the future.

## The stack

The stack can be thought of as a LIFO queue, meaning data is always added to the end last and removed from the end first.
It is not possible to push or pop into other regions of the stack.

### Integers

Integers are defined by writing any (whole) number.

```forth
//Stack before: [ ]
1 2 3
//Stack after: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
-10 -4
//Stack after: [ 1, 2, 3, -10, -4 ]
```

### Strings

String are defined by putting text between double quotes `"`.
Strings are stored in a special place in memory.
When defining a string, the length of the string and a pointer to the memory address are pushed onto the stack.

```forth
//Stack before: [ ]
"hello"
//Stack after: [ 5, *ptr ]
"this is a string with spaces"
//Stack after: [ 5, *ptr, 28, *ptr ]
```

## Memory

**Allocating memory**

```forth
memory <mem_name> <size> end
```

**Storing data into memory**

```forth
<value> <mem_name> store   //Store a byte (lowest 8 bits) in <mem_name>
<value> <mem_name> store16 //Store 2 bytes (lowest 16 bits) in <mem_name>
<value> <mem_name> store32 //Store an integer (4 bytes) in <mem_name>
```

**Loading data from memory**

```forth
<mem_name> load   //Places a byte from <mem_name> on the stack
<mem_name> load16 //Places a 16-bit number from <mem_name> (as an int) on the stack
<mem_name> load32 //Places an int from <mem_name> on the stack
```

## Functions

Code can be reused by wrapping it in a function.

**Get the bigger of two numbers:**

```forth
function max(int int -> int)
  over over < if swap end
  pop
end

1 2 max
```

**Print a string to stderr:**

```forth
function printE(str)
  2 1 syscall3
end

"This is an error" printE
```

## Variables

Working with the stack can sometimes result in code looking like a jungle of keywords like `dup`, `over`, `swap` and `rot`.
To combat this, data on the stack can be bound to variables.

```forth
//Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
var (a b c d e)
  a dump // 1
  b dump // 2
  c dump // 3
  d dump // 4
  e dump // 5
  a dump // 1
  a dump // 1
end
```

Variables will be consumed when binding, but can be used multiple times without the need to duplicate them. If you want to retain the variables on the stack, you can simply call them without consuming
them before the end of the block.
Variables consume N items from the end of the stack, with N being the number of variable names.

## Imports

Files can import other files, virtually merging the two files.
Imports are defined by declaring a path to the file to import as a string.
The file path is relative to the file the `import` was made from, NOT the current working directory.

All imported content will be available right after the `import` call, but not before it.

```forth
//Valid:
import "math.fey"
1 2 max
print

//Not valid:
1 2 max
import "math.fey"
print
```

The Java interpreter has a special `class:` prefix to load a file from the Java ClassPath.
`class:/some/pkg/name/file.fey` will attempt to load the `file.fey` file from the `some.pkg.name` package.

## SysCall

It is possible to execute [syscalls](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/constants/syscalls.md#x86_64-64_bit) in Feylon.
The syscall function to use depends on the number of arguments of the syscall.
Arguments should be pushed to the stack in reverse order.
